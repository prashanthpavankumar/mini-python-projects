🐍 Python Mini Projects – Fundamentals Collection
This repository contains beginner-friendly Python scripts focused on core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries), and NumPy for matrix operations. Organized into folders for clarity and learning progression.

📁 Folder Structure
🔹 Basic-calculations
File	Description
duplicate.py	Detects and prints duplicate elements in a list using nested loops and a set.
gpacalci.py	Takes marks for 5 subjects and calculates the total, percentage, and GPA.
palindrome.py	Reverses a number or string and checks if it is a palindrome.
prime.py	Checks if a number is prime using square root optimization and prints its factors.
second_largest.py	Identifies the second-largest number in a list without using built-in sorting.

🔹 frequency
File	Description
Letter_frequency.py	Counts the frequency of each alphabet letter in a given string.
Number_frequency.py	Takes a number input and counts how many times each digit appears using a dictionary.
count_letters_digits_specials.py	Analyzes a string to count the number of letters, digits, and special characters.
word_frequency.py	Splits a sentence into words and counts how many times each word appears.

🔹 matrix
File	Description
matrix_multiplication.py	Takes two matrices from user input and performs matrix multiplication using NumPy.
nparray.py	Creates a matrix using NumPy, calculates transpose, sum, mean, row-wise and column-wise sums.
hi.txt	(Placeholder file; can be removed.)
